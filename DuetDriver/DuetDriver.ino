* Jul 5th 2021 eeeee
* 
* depth measurements were extremely erroneous, often way too low.
* - increased the number of samples to be averaged from 8 to 32 and made the 
*   number of samples a #define (see depth_samples and speed_buckets) 
* - switched all pins from "INPUT" to "INPUT_PULLUP" as there were spurious
*   signals detected by the speed log, resulting in a 1Kn displayed speed at rest
*   that was not an issue once there were true pulses coming in. Seems the built in
*   micro is a bit over-sensitive.
*   
* Jul 8th 2021
* depth measurement was faulty as almost every 2nd measurement showed 0. Implemented a gate of min 20ms, 
* now the correct depth is shown.
* ready to use.
